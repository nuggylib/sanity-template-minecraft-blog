## Who this is for

### Minecraft Modders

Often times, Minecraft modders are budding developers who are trying to build up a portfolio. This template will help you moderate your site content via the Sanity studio. You can then hook it up to a static site generator so that you can demonstrate it however you'd like, whether it be by having a neatly-polished user-facing site, or a highly-technical dev-oriented site (such as one discussing the technical details of how you implemented your mod).
